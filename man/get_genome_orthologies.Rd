\title{Query all orthologies related to each genome in the dataset}
\usage{
get_genome_orthologies(data, pathway_orthologies = NULL,
  kegg_orthology = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a tibble with genomes and genome_id or the output from `get_genome_id()`}

\item{pathway_orthologies}{a vector of pathway orthologies}

\item{kegg_orthology}{a kegg_tbl with the columns orthology and orthology_id
which can be generated with the get_kegg_orthology function. If NULL (default)
the KEGGerator::kegg_orthologies dataset will be used}
}
\description{
Query all orthologies related to each genome in the dataset
}
\details{
if `pathway_orthologies` is NULL (default) than all orthologies for each genome
will be returned. If a vector of orthology_ids is provided than only the orthologies related
to each genome that are in this vector will be returned. This is useful if used in
coordination with the output of `get_pathway_orthologies` to only include the orthologies
that are related with the pathway of interest.
